# Contributing

Every form of positive engagement, feedback and contribution is welcome!


## Ideas

Some ideas of how you can contribute and make Coachybot better:
- Testing of and feedback on Coachybot in the messenger of your choice (if you want to test my 'master' version of Coachybot in Facebook Messenger, please let me know and I will register you as a test user!)
- Extending the coaching dialog in width, depth, robustness, style and degree of personalization. Some examples:
    - Especially the part between 'How are you?' and the problem statement could be more smooth and robust.
    - Checking back on the committment of a user of an action (like "Tomorrow I will sign up for gym!")
    - Making Coachybot react approporiately on insults, perving and genuine compliments
- Implementing an interface for Telegram, Slack and other messengers, and maybe even Alexa
- Adding unit tests for the messenger interfaces
- Improving state and flow control
- Ideas for a better software architecture
- Improving and adding skills
- Extending or modifying the documentation (readme, installation, background, contributing...)
- Feedback on the presentation of this repository, especially in terms of contributer-friendlyness

More ideas are very welcome!
