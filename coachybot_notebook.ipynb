    "- `has_dislike()` tests whether the statement contains a negative subjective judgement like 'I can't stand these stupid questions'\n",
    "- `has_danger_to_self()` tests whether the statement indicates a desire to harm oneself, like 'I just wish I was dead!'. In this case, Coachybot will advise the user to contact a suicide prevention hotline.\n",

    "- Using sentiment analysis like Vader. The same here: I spent some hours with experimentation, but so far the results have not been convincing.\n",
